Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
----------------------------------------

create a Tidy Data Set from Samsung Galaxy S smartphone accelerometer readings

the reference location for the data project is
  **http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones**
with the data used in this project at
  **https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip**

the data is divided into train and test data sets with unlabeled factors described in additional files.  By downloading the data to a working directory and running
  **run_analysis.R**

a tidy data set named 
  **tidy_data_set.txt**
will be created with the mean sensor readings for all train and test data aggregated for subjects and activities.

Additional information about the data can be found in CodeBook.md and in the documents included with the project data.
